# Deploy a Serverless Web Application using the Amazon Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

>***Author's Note:*** 
>The intended audience for this tutorial is developers, cloud architects, and DevOps professionals who already have a basic understanding of cloud computing and have an existing AWS account.  This tutorial also assumes a basic understanding of object oriented programming.

>I envision that this tutorial could be part one of a larger series where learners could eventually build out a full scale web application following the example architecture presented in the *CDK Project Structure* section of this tutorial.

The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is a framework used to define cloud infrastructure as code.  With the AWS CDK we can use our favorite object-oriented programming languages to build reliable, scalable, and secure applications in the AWS cloud without manually deploying infrastructure.

***In this tutorial we will learn:***
- The value proposition of the AWS CDK
- The bulding blocks of AWS CDK applications (Constructs, Apps, and Stacks)
- The basic structure of AWS CDK projects
- The lifecycle of a CDK application

Once we understand what the AWS CDK is all about, we will use our new CDK skills to deploy a website to the cloud!

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 10-15 min (not including prerequisites)

**Cost**: All AWS resources deployed in this tutorial fall within the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier-faqs/).  Make sure to follow clean up steps in 7 of this tutorial.

## The Power of CDK

A CDK application defines a cloud application or cloud infrastructure configuration.  We can deploy the exact same CDK application one time or hundreds of times.  This functionality is powerful for several reasons:

- :shield: **Security**: Define resuable components that are modeled to meet security best practices as well as your organization's security and compliance requirements.  Minimize human error by modeling and sharing vetted configurations via the CDK.
- :moneybag: **Cost Savings**: Use the AWS CDK to provision and destroy entire cloud architectures with ease.  Destroy cloud infrastructure when it's not needed to avoid paying for unnecesary resources.  Use the AWS CDK to re-deploy the exact same infrastructure in seconds when it's needed again.
- :detective: **Best Practices Built-in**: Create and reuse patterns built using cloud best practices.  Take advantage of 1000+ high-quality [existing, open-source CDK libraries](https://constructs.dev/) to deploy common cloud infrastructure patterns.

## Constructs, Stacks, and Apps

CDK applications are created using three important concepts: constructs, stacks, and apps.
- **Constructs**: Constructs are the building blocks of your CDK application.  A construct represents a *cloud component* that will be deployed in your cloud environment.  A cloud component could be one resource - such as one [Amazon S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - or a cloud component could resprent a higher-level abstraction such as an [application load balancer fronting containers running in the Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-alb-fargate.html).  CDK Constructs are powerful because they can be used to define common infrastructure patterns using best practices - once defined, CDK Constructs make best practice patterns easily sharable and repeatable.
- **Stacks**: Stacks are the unit of deployment in the AWS CDK.  Every AWS resource defined using a CDK construct must be definied within the scope of a stack.  When you deploy your CDK application you will choose whether to deploy every stack in the application, only certain stacks in the application, or even multiple copies of the same stack.
- **Apps**: A CDK application or app is a container for one or more stacks.  Stacks within the same CDK app can exchange information with one another.  A powerful feature of CDK is automatic dependency management between stacks - if one construct in Stack A is dependent on the deployment of a construct in Stack B - CDK will automatically deploy the stacks in the neccesary order to fulfill that dependency.  

![img](readme-assets/cdk_application_diagram.png)

> :bulb:*Tip:* A CDK application (or app) is a container for multiple stacks.  A CDK stack is a container for multiple CDK constructs.  CDK constructs represent a cloud component that will be deployed to your cloud environment.

Consider what this architecture could look like in practice.  Perhaps we want to host a [serverless web application](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/b0c6ad36-0a4b-45d8-856b-8a64f0ac76bb/en-US) in the cloud.  Here is an example of a typical serverless architecture:

![img](readme-assets/example_serverless_architecture.png)

> :bulb:*Tip:* This application is serverless because it can be built and maintained without provisioning and maintaining servers.  All server management is abstracted away by AWS.

Let's say we like this serverless architecture a lot and we know our team will want to deploy many similar architectures in the future.  Or maybe we need to deploy our serverless application seperately in several different countries.  Or maybe both!  Sounds like a perfect use case for the AWS CDK.  Below is an example of how we can organize our serverless web application into a CDK application using constructs, stacks, and apps.

![img](readme-assets/cdk_application_serverless_web_app_diagram.png)
> :bulb:*Tip:* Remember that when we deploy our application we can choose whether to deploy every stack or just some stacks.  We could deploy all three stacks first our first application deployment and then only re-deploy the Front End or Compute stack as needed during sebsequent deployments while leaving the database stack untouched.  

Apps, stacks, and constructs promote modularity and re-use.  If we wanted to deploy a different website with the same architecture, we could re-use the entire CDK application.   If we had a different application where we just needed a static website with no data store or compute logic we could re-use only our Front End stack from this CDK app with no problem. If we have an individiual construct perfectly configured to meet our security requirements we can easily plug that construct into countless other stacks and applications.

## CDK Application Lifecycle

We are about to build our first cdk application!  We will work with CDK using the command line interface.  Familiarizing yourself with common CDK commands is a great way to familiarize yourself with the overall lifecycle of a CDK application.  Take a moment to review the graphic below.  These commands are the same for Windows, Linux, and MacOS users.
![img](readme-assets/cdk_app_lifecycle.png)

* *note that CloudFormation is out of scope for this tutorial but an important tool to familiarize yourself with in order to build infrastructure as code expertise.  Check out the [CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) to learn more.*

## Let's Build a CDK App!

Now that we know what the AWS CDK is all about, let's get hands on and deploy our first CDK application!  In this lab we will use the AWS CDK to configure and deploy a simple static S3 website hosted in the AWS cloud. 
> :bulb:*Tip:* Remember to review the list of pre-requisites at the beginning of the tutorial.  Every pre-requisite is mandatory.

> :bulb:*Tip:* If you get stuck or lost throughout the tutorial you can refer to the code for the completed solution located in the cdk_static_website_COMPLETED directory within this repository. 

## Step 1: Configure Your Dev Environment
### Install the AWS CDK Toolkit
The AWS CDK Toolkit is a command-line utility that you will use to orchestrate your CDK applications.  Windows, Mac, and Linux users can install the CDK Toolkit by running the following command:

*(Note: Windows users should run this command as an Aministrator and Mac/Linux users should run this command using `sudo`)*

`npm install -g aws-cdk`

Verify your AWS CDK Toolkit installation by running

`cdk --version`

*Expected Output*:
![img](readme-assets/cdk_version_EO.png)

### Select Your Programming Language
AWS CDK offers you the opportunity to model and deploy cloud infrastructure using your object-oriented programming language of choice - no need to learn new syntax!  CDK is currently available for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go with more languages to come.  

Depending on your choice of programming language, you may encounter additional prequisites.  For this tutorial we will be using Python and we need the following tools installed on our system:
- [ ] [Python version 3.6 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ ] [Python package installer (pip)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Verify your Python installation by running 
`python --version` or `python3 --version`

![img](readme-assets/python3_version_EO.png)

## Step 2: Create Your First CDK Application
### Intialize a CDK Project
Create an empty directory where your CDK application will live:

`mkdir cdk_static_website && cd cdk_static_website`

The `cdk init` command creates a new, empty CDK project.  Run `cdk init --help` to see the options available to us when we create a new project.  

For this tutorial we will create a new CDK project using a sample-app template and we will build our CDK application using Python.  Run the `cdk init` command using the following options:

`cdk init sample-app --language python`

*Expected Output:*

![img](readme-assets/cdk_init_EO.png)

### Activate our virtual environment and install required modules
A virtual environment allows us to install packages and run our Python application without impacting the Python installation on our system.  [Learn more about virtual environments here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

Let's activate our virtual environment by running the following command, make sure to run this command from within your cdk_static_website/ directory.

Linux/MacOS:

`source .venv/bin/activate`

Windows:

`.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

> Your python installation should have virtual environment functionality built in.  if your virtual environment activation fails you may need to manually create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv .venv`

Once we have activated our virtual environment, we can install the required Python modules for our project by running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now that we are familiar with our project structure and we have installed the required modules, we can get to work with CDK!

> If you havent already, now is a good time to open your IDE.  If you are using VS Code you can open the project directory in VS code by running `code .` 

![image](readme-assets/cdk_python_project_structure.png)

As you can see, in the processes of initializing our project the CDK Toolkit has created several pre-configured files and directories for us.  For now we will focus on the most critical files.  [Read more about CDK project structure and components here](https://cdkworkshop.com/30-python/20-create-project/300-structure.html).
- ***app.py***: the entry point for our CDK application, similar to a "main" file.
- ***cdk_static_website/cdk_static_website.py***: a Python file that creates a custom CDK stack for use in your CDK application.  We will learn more about stacks when we model and deploy our application in step 4 of this tutorial.  A production CDK application will likely grow to have several different files defining several different stacks. 
- ***cdk.json*** A configuration file for CDK that defines several aspects of our application and how it should operate.  
- ***README.md***: A README describing our CDK application and basic deployment steps.  Notice we can find several useful tips and CDK commands prepopulated in the README by the CDK toolkit.  Eventually we should customize this README file to be specific to the CDK application we build.
- Notice that the CDK toolkit also initialized a ***git repository*** for us in the project directory and populated a .gitignore file that we can modify as needed.

## Step 3: Bootstrap Your AWS Account

Our next step is to prepare our AWS environment for CDK deployments.  An AWS environment is a combincation of the AWS account and AWS region where we are provisioning our cloud resources.  We prepare our AWS environment using a process called CDK Bootstrap.  The CDK Bootstrap script will provision several resources in our AWS environment. CDK will rely on these resources behind the scenes when our CDK applications are being deployed.

Bootstrapping an AWS environment is a one-time process.  You will not need to run CDK Bootstrap again until you start deploying CDK applications in different AWS regions or a different AWS account.[Read more about CDK Bootstrap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html)

Bootstrap your AWS environment by running: 

`cdk bootstrap`

*Expected Output*:

![img](readme-assets/bootstrap_existed_output.png)

## Step 4: Design our Application

Remember that the unit of deployment in the AWS CDK is called a ***stack***.  Within our CDK stacks we will use Python to define the resources we want to provision in the AWS cloud.  Let's get started by opening `cdk_static_website/cdk_static_website_stack.py`.  The file in it's current state will look something like this:

![img](readme-assets/cdk_static_website_stack%20_init_view.png)

> :bulb:*Tip:* If your IDE gives you warnings like `Import "aws_cdk" could not be resolved` the most likely cause is a IDE miconfiguration related to your Python interpreter.  Fixing this is out of scope for this tutorial, however you can safely ignore these warnings as long you have followed all the previous instructions correctly. 

This example code will deploy two AWS resources: a [Amazon SQS Queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and a [Amazon SNS Topic](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).  

Let's delete the existing code in `cdk_static_website_stack.py` and replace it with the following code block:

```
from constructs import Construct
from aws_cdk import ( 
    Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3, 
    aws_s3_deployment as s3_deploy,
    RemovalPolicy,
)

class CdkStaticWebsiteStack(Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)
        
        #create a s3 bucket to host our static website
        static_website_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "StaticS3Bucket",
            public_read_access=True,
            block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(restrict_public_buckets = False),
            website_index_document='index.html',
            website_error_document='error.html',
            removal_policy= RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
            auto_delete_objects=True
        )

        #upload the html documents from s3-assets/ directory to the s3 bucket
        deployment = s3_deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWebsite",
            sources=[s3_deploy.Source.asset("../s3-assets")],
            destination_bucket=static_website_bucket
        )
```

This block of code imports several CDK modules and then uses those modules to model cloud infrastructure.  Specifcally,we are defining the CdkStaticWebsiteStack.  The CdkStaticWebsiteStack will include two constructs:
- a [S3bucket construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/python/aws_cdk.aws_s3/Bucket.html) configured with the neccesary settings to support static website hosting.  This construct will create a new s3 Bucket to our AWS cloud environment.
> :siren: *SECURITY ALERT* : Almost all S3 bucket deployments will be configured to set the block_public_access property to true.  In this project we are using a special S3 bucket configuration designed for website hosting.  It is critically important that we do not store ANY other files or obejcts in this S3 bucket other than files you want to be publicly available on a public website. :siren:
- a [BucketDeployment construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_s3_deployment/BucketDeployment.html) which is used to upload assets to our newly created bucket.  In this case we will use the BucketDeployment construct to upload the html files we want to serve from our bucket.

> :bulb:*Tip:* As we learn, we are copying and pasting existing code to get the feel of working with the CDK.  When you are designing and coding your own CDK applications you will use the [CDK API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/python/modules.html) to make decisions about what code to write.  You can see examples of the CDK API documentation by clicking the S3Bucket construct and BucketDeployment construct links above.  

Open the `app.py` file located in the root of our project directory.  

We do not need to make any changes to `app.py` but let's take a look at what is going on here.  `app.py` is the application entry point, meaning when we deploy our CDK application the deployment process will begin by running the code in `app.py`.

![img](readme-assets/app_py_from_template.png)

- On line 5, we are importing the CdkStaticWebsite stack we just defined.  
- On line 7 we instantiate our application and on line 8 we add the CdkStaticWebsite stack to our application.
- When `app.synth()` runs on line 10, CDK will know to synthesize our application and deploy our resources.

In our static website app we are only deploying one stack but here is an example of what `app.py` might look like for a production scale CDK application with multiple stacks.
![img](readme-assets/production_app_py.png). 

## Step 5: Synthesize and Deploy our Application
We have successfully designed our cdk application using constructs and stacks.  Let's get this website in the cloud!

### CDK Synth 

Start by running the `cdk synth` command.  

Run:

`cdk synth`

*Expected Output*:

#TO-DO

The output of `cdk synth` will be quite lengthy for our first deployment.  We are seeing an overview of everything that will be deployed in our AWS account when our app is deployed.  In production, it is best practice to review the output of the `cdk synth` command closely, but for the purpose of this tutorial we can move on.

The `cdk synth` command synthesizes our CDK code into a CloudFormation template.  We don't need to know about CloudFormation templates for the purposes of this tutorial, but note that a new directory `cdk.out` has appeared in our project.  This is where synthesized CloudFormation templates are stored.

`cdk synth` will fail if we have syntax errors in our code - this is useful because we can correct errors before we try to deploy our resources rather than having a deployment fail. 

### CDK Deploy

So far, we have done a lot of designing and planning but we have not yet provisioned any cloud infrastructure.  The `cdk deploy` command will trigger the actual deployment of resources in our account based on the code in our cdk app. This is also the point where we will start to incur charges for any resources we provision.  

Run: 

`cdk deploy`

#TO-DO: Expected output

:siren: We will be asked to review any Identity and Access Management (IAM Changes) that will be made when our cdk application is deployed.  This step adds awareness of security implications for our cloud environment resulting from this deployment.  In production we should review these changes very closely, here we can select **y** to approve the changes and deploy the stack.  

#TO-DO: Expected output

We will watch as our resources are deployed.  Upon successful deployment of the stack we are given an *Stack ARN*.  ARN stands for Amazon Resource Number and is a unique identifier within all of AWS.  If our application had deployed more than one stack, we would see multiple *Stack ARNs* displayed.  

Upon successful deployment we can open the AWS console and navigate to the CloudFormation console.  The CloudFormation console allows us to view our newly deployed stack.
> :bulb:*Tip:* Did you notice another stack in your CloudFormation console called *CDK Toolkit*?  This stack was deployed by us earlier when we ran `cdk bootstrap`.

#TO-DO: Console view

## Step 6: Update Your Application

Our CDK application deployment was a success and our S3 Website is live and running.  Of course, we want to see the website in action!  We can manually find the URL for our new website using the S3 console within AWS, but that's a bit of a pain.  Wouldn't it be better if we could get the website URL as an output once our stack is deployed?  

This is a great opportunity to practice iterative development and improve our application by making an update to our cdk code.  

Open `cdk_static_website\cdk_static_website_stack.py` and make a few edits.

We will import the Cfn output CDK module and use it to output information about the resources we deploy.
- update the imports at the top of your file to include CfnOutput as an imported python class: 
```
from constructs import Construct
from aws_cdk import ( 
    Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3, 
    aws_s3_deployment as s3_deploy,
    CfnOutput
)
```
- at the bottom of the file on line 28 add:
```
#output s3 bucket URL when stack is deployed
CfnOutput(self, "S3 Website Url", value=static_website_bucket.bucket_website_url)
```
Let's also increase the security posture of our web app by enforcing access logging on our s3 bucket.  We can do this by adding a line of code to our s3 bucket construct.  Replace our current bucket construct with a construct that enforces server access logging and deploys a second, private S3 Bucket for log storage.

```     
#create a s3 bucket to host our static website
static_website_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "StaticS3Bucket",
    public_read_access=True,
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(restrict_public_buckets = False),
    website_index_document='index.html',
    website_error_document='error.html',
    server_access_logs_bucket= s3.Bucket(self, 'static_website_logging_bucket')
)
```

After making these changes, `cdk_static_website\cdk_static_website_stack.py` should look like this: 

![img](readme-assets/updated_stack_py.png)

Implement our changes by running 

`cdk deploy`

Don't forget to select *y* when prompted in order to approve the deployment of our changes. 
![img](readme-assets/deploy_changes_approval.png)

*Expected Output*:
![img](readme-assets/deploy_changes_success_EO.png)

Awesome!  Now we can click on the link outputted in our terminal and see our brand new *Hello World* website deployed using the AWS CDK.  
> :bulb:*Tip:* Curious about the error.html document we references in our S3 bucket configuration?  Append error.html to the end of our S3 Website URL and see what happens.  Because we correctly configured our S3 Bucket construct, our bucket is already set up to route web traffic as if it was a traditional web server.  If a user enters an invalid URL, they will be redirected to either the index.html or error.html files we deployed to our bucket using CDK.  

![img](readme-assets/website_hello_world_EO.png) ![img](readme-assets/error_page_EO.png)

## Step 7: Destroy Your Application

It's time to practice the last step of the CDK application lifecycle and tear down our application.  We will delete every resource we created by destroying the entire CDK app at once.  Don't worry, now that you are a CDK 

Run:

`cdk destroy`

*Expected Output*:

> :bulb:*Tip:* Make sure to complete step 7 and completely destroy all resources in order to avoid incurring future AWS charges

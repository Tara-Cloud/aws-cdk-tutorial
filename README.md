# Getting Started with the Amazon Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

## The Power of CDK
- security
- cost savings
- best practices built in

## Pre-Requisites
- [ ] An [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) of your choice.  We will be editing code throughout this tutorial.  One great option is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- [ ] AWS Account
-- :lightbulb: Security tip: root credentials to deploy resources is not a good practice
- [ ] Credentials for a Role/User with at least the following priviledges...
- [ ] [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [ ] [Node.js (>= 10.13.0, except for versions 13.0.0 - 13.6.0)](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Step 1: Configure Your Dev Environment
### Install the AWS CDK Toolkit
The AWS CDK Toolkit is a command-line utility that you will use to orchestrate your CDK applications.  To install the CDK toolkit run the following commands.
(Note: Windows users should run this as an Aministrator and Mac/Linux users should run this using `sudo`)
`npm install -g aws-cdk`

Verify your installation by running `cdk --version`

## Step 2: Bootstrap Your Account

## Step 3: Create Your First CDK Application

## Step 4: Deploy Your Application to the Cloud 

## Step 5: Update Your Application

## Step 6: Destroy Your Application

## What to Build Next? 
- React App hosted in s3
- s3 behind API gateway with a lambda authenticator
- level 3 s3 website construct

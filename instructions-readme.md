# Technical curriculum developer - take home project

This is the home project for individuals interviewing for the Technical Curriculum Developer role at Datadog

## Description

Write a short tutorial on a technical topic for software developers, security professionals, or SREs that satisfies these requirements:

- Create a single text-based tutorial in Markdown that would take a student about ten minutes to complete.
- It should be published in this GitHub repository and follow best practices for storing code in Git repositories. Auxiliary demo code or other assets for the student can also be stored in the same repository.
- Pick a non-trivial technical topic you are already familiar with and are passionate about. You should aim to spend less than 90 minutes preparing the content, with a suggested maximum of four hours.
- Include a README file describing the topic (you can overwrite this one or create it in a sub-folder for your tutorial), the intended audience, prerequisite knowledge, learning objectives, and anything else a reviewer should know before beginning the module.

Possible topics include: a coding language, a cloud service (AWS, GCP, Azure), application development, Kubernetes, cloud security, etc.

- How to write and use a promise in JavaScript to do something useful
- How to use a list comprehension in Python for a business task
- A short Terraform configuration to create and then modify any resource (Docker container, cloud instance, etc.)
- Load data from an Excel file into R and manipulate it somehow
- Any other single hands-on concept in any language or cloud platform

Your training module should be directed towards an audience of learners who are familiar with the general domain, but not this particular topic.

The module must include a hands-on component to teach the audience how to perform a task or complete a workflow that is not obvious and is not already well-documented. The interview panel should be able to follow the steps you outline using technical tools that are reasonably accessible.

- Avoid a tutorial that does nothing other than install a single piece of software
- Avoid a tutorial that is completely UI based (it should include some amount of code, terminal commands, or raw data)
- Avoid a tutorial that reads data but does nothing else with it

This module should be newly created for this prompt. All text, graphics, or videos must be created by you.

You have full creative control over any aspects of this module that have not been specified.

### Rubric

Consider running `vale .` against the content you create, which will suggest improvements based on a [Vale](https://vale.sh/) style guide.

You may wish to review the Datadog Learning Center (https://learn.datadoghq.com) for inspiration and to better understand how Datadog structures courses, but do not use Datadog as your primary topic.

Your work will be evaluated based on the technical complexity of the topic, accuracy of the content, how well it is taught to the target audience in 10 minutes, how well the content meets the learning objectives, and how it all fits together.

If you have any questions at all, communicate with your Datadog recruiter.
